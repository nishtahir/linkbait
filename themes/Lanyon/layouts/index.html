        This section contains the content of our home page.

        I have broken it into three main sections:
          (1) about the blog
          (2) about me
          (3) Recent posts

        The first two sections are pretty self explanatory.

        In the recent posts section we ask Hugo to use the template found in
        /layouts/posts/summary.html to show a summary of the 10 most recent
        posts we have made.

        <h1>Oh, Hi! You've stumbled upon the Linkbait development blog</h1>
        <br></br>

        <h2 class="post-title">What is Linkbait?</h2>

        <p>Linkbait is a bot framework that's awesome. It's got a whole bunch of neat features, but most
        importantly, it's super extensible with support for plugins. It's a really easy way to super charge your Slack or Discord</p>

        <img src="/images/linkbait-gif-screenshot.png">

        <h2 class="post-title">What does it do?</h2>
        <p>Pretty much everything. It's got gifs, delicious nutella, unfurls links from app stores,
          steam and even subreddit mentions, a meme generator and <a href="https://gitlab.com/nishtahir/linkbait/tree/master/linkbait-plugins">much much more</a>.</p>
        <p>Did I mention that it has a Pokedex?</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="post-title">What platforms are supported?</h2>
        <p>It currently supports Slack and Discord, but we are working to support new clients everyday.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="post-title">How much is all this awesomeness going to cost me?</h2>
        <p>Nothing it's free and <a href="https://gitlab.com/nishtahir/linkbait/">open source</a>.</p>
