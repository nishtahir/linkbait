So today another plugin has been added to Linkbait. This time focusing on helping you land
your dream job, the jobs plugin for Linkbait does a little web scraping to find new and relevant job postings, right in the comfort of your Slack client. It only returns new listings; posts that are less than 24 hours old and in the location of your choice.
