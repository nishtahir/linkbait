Everyone loves gifs. Okay maybe not everyone. A lot of people love gifs. They are
the backbone of all conversations on slack. We've all experienced the extremely lacking
relevance of a lot of gif plugins on slack.

> Asks for an explosion. Gif of shoe shows up.

In search of the most relevant gif delivery service, we've added a gif plugin to Linkbait.
It uses the [Tenor](https://www.tenor.co/) api in the back ground and is invoked using the
`gif` command.

Hopefully this adds a bit more personality to your conversations.
