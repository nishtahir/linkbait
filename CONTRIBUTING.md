# Contributing to Linkbait

Thanks for your contributions to the project. The feedback and efforts of the community
have helped make this project possible and are the reason why it continues to exist.

If this is your first time contributing, this guide will help get you started.

## Report bugs / Pitch ideas

This is the easiest way to contribute. You can do this through the issue tracker.
Begin by making sure that your bug/idea hasn't already been reported/pitched. If it
has been, please show your support by leaving a comment or reacting with an appropriate
emoji.

## Improve documentation

Also rather easy but well appreciated.

## Write code

Fix a bug or add an issue and contribute by making a merge request. Adhering to good programming
practices and coding style similar to that used in the project is appreciated.

Make sure that tests pass and your commit is at the tip of the development branch before making a
merge request.

## Write tests

This is perhaps the most appreciated thing you can do. Doing this will earn you many many tacos :)

## Suggest better DevOps

From CI to deployment, I'm always looking for better ways to optimize and make things run smoother.
All suggestions here are welcome.
